# MalX Core  
**Foundational primitives for the MalX ecosystem.**

MalX Core defines the shared concepts, execution-flow models, and adversarial building blocks used across the MalX platform.  
It provides the structural backbone for experimentation, tooling, and research.

## Purpose
- Establish consistent abstractions for malware execution.
- Provide reusable components for loaders, stagers, and runtime manipulation.
- Serve as the central reference point for MalX architecture and design.

## Focus Areas
- Execution-flow primitives  
- Payload interfaces  
- Staging and chaining models  
- Evasion and runtime manipulation patterns  
- Shared libraries and utilities  

## Status
Early-stage research. APIs and structures are subject to change.

## Ethos
Precision over noise. Research over marketing. Malicious by design.
